        <div class="about">
            <p>My name is <b>Daniela Archibong</b>.

                I have always had an interest in design, internet and programming. My first computer was the
                <u>PREcomputer1000</u> that came with a manual on learning BASIC programming.</p>

            <p>In junior high, I owned my own domain that allowed me to design 'web cliques' and host other people
                interested in creating their own website. I joined the afterschool club, <em>'TechnoHawks'</em>, just so
                I had faster internet I could use to upload files through my FTP server. Throughout high school, I took
                digital imaging classes and learned how to manipulate photos through photoshop, illustrator, etc.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>After years of technical support roles, I realized my passion is in knowing how things work and building
                projects. I am actively working on re-learning what I taught myself in the past as well as expanding my
                knowledge in various programming languages. Also, I am working on learning the various tools that are
                used in group projects in a professional environment.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I am teaching myself how to use the terminal in Linux to work on as many projects as I
                can. I am working on a Ubuntu 18.04LTS setup on my Lenovo IdeaPad. I am also attending classes at Austin
                Coding Academy.</p>
